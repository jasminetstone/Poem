A poem app, composed back in '14  
That spins deep webs of metaphors and verse  
All java, with some markdown in between  
declaring types, for better or for worse

Will be no help in learning what it's for  
I'd love to put the 'hub' back into 'git'  
I want to understand, to gain rapport!  
  
But then it dawns - this repo __is__ the poem  
These scripts and folders, yes! They are the craft!  
That [Jasmine Stone](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7615686/), she knows just how to show 'em  
I've never seen a brain so fully staffed  
  
I can with perl-y eyes objective-see:  
There is no soul with poems quite like she
